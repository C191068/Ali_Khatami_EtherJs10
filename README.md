## Deploying to a Testnet or Mainnet

Now here we gonn adeploy our contract at https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs9 <br>
on a Sepolia testnet <br>


![m34](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/639b537f-fe1c-4358-a267-1f4b30218a9b)

to make transcation on blockchain  we need RPC URL and private key <br>

So we all gonna need Sepolia RPC URL and Sepolia private key <br>


If we want to do everything on our own in a full decentralized context  <br>

we can run Sepolia version of Geth <br>

We can run it locally and just connect it to our Geth node <br>

here we gonna use third party RPC URL <br>

Alchemy has a node as a service and allow us to conncet any blockchain they have support for <br>

some alternatives might br :
quick node , moralis or infura <br>

we will go the above link https://www.alchemy.com/ <br>

and we will click here ```Get Started for free ``` and create a new account  <br>


![m36](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/e3a408b3-96eb-42e6-b392-9a3ea99f5f71)

after sign up and sign in we can open the dashboard <br>

![m37](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/78d30f37-98b7-4939-826f-ca2195b96824)

here we will select the above button <br>

![m38](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/e45b79b5-3a4c-43eb-a7b6-35f75da219b1)

here at fisrt we gonna Ethereum blockchain and then as a network Ethereum Sepolia <br>

then give name and description and click create app <br>

![m39](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/a32bde4c-03d4-45fa-b144-c27f59972226)

here we can see ton of information about the node and different ways to conncet to the node <br>


![m40](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/81f667f1-1b5b-4f37-8368-ab6738a1220a)

this gonna be very similiar to RPC server at ganache <br>

except it gonna be aconncetion to a real tset


![m41](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/17bce838-7983-499d-a504-490917e166b0)

here we select the view key <br>

![m42](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/2ed06a8d-c263-4d71-ae52-6fd9ba41f92f)

here we can see we have the API key ,HTTPS and websocket <br>

![m43](https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs10/assets/89090776/05210f75-f48d-44ec-bf7b-de464891755a)

we are only concerned with the HTTP endpoint <br>
 This gonna be tha RPC URL that connects to Sepolia <br>
