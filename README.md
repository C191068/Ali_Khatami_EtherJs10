## Deploying to a Testnet or Mainnet

Now here we gonn adeploy our contract at https://github.com/C191068/Ali_Khatami_EtherJs9 <br>
on a Sepolia testnet <br>

to make transcation on blockchain  we need RPC URL and private key <br>

So we all gonna need Sepolia RPC URL and Sepolia private key <br>


If we want to do everything on our own in a full decentralized context  <br>

we can run Sepolia version of Geth <br>

We can run it locally and just connect it to our Geth node <br>

here we gonna use third party RPC URL <br>

Alchemy has a node as a service and allow us to conncet any blockchain they have support for <br>

some alternatives might br :
quick node , moralis or infura <br>
